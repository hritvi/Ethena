# Complaint Classifier

This web app is our team's submission for SDSLabs Hackathon 'Syntax Error'. This app aims to resolve all the conflicts that are encountered while filing complaints in government agencies. The recurrent unaddressing of problems is another issue that we face here.

### The Solution
We aimed to make the task of filing complaints simpler by providing an online interface. We have used a sentiment analysis api to judge whether the complaint must be addressed right now or can be delayed a bit. The complaints can be tracked and we can find out the status of the complaint.

### Setup Instructions

run `npn install`

### Running Instructions
run `npm start`
